 * crash-detection). Nothing here introduces a fact from outside one of those two
 * sources — no invented metrics, dates, team sizes, feature lists, or outcomes.
 *
 * inqaz and crash-detection are related but are NOT the same model stack, and the
 * copy must not blur them: inqaz runs a dual ResNet-34 system (InqazSceneNet +
 * InqazPoseNet, validation accuracy figures), crash-detection is a scoped-down
 * TensorFlow CNN/MobileNetV2 classifier on the same problem (F1 on a held-out
 * test set). Different models, datasets, metrics, and splits — never compare the
 * numbers across the two pages.
 *
 * Where a real detail page needs something this repo does not contain, the copy
 * carries an inline `[[ ... ]]` marker. The renderer in
 * src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx turns those into a loud dashed-amber placeholder
 * (the same `<Fill>` treatment used in src/pages/CaseStudyLMMS.tsx), and each one
 * has a `TODO(laila)` comment beside it. Fill them in or delete the sentence —
 * never let a placeholder ship as prose, and never replace one with a guess.

        body: "The raw dataset is extracted frames rather than isolated incidents, and I executed the train/test split at frame level. That means near-duplicate frames of the same physical incident inevitably land on both sides of the divide, so the model has already seen something very close to parts of its own test set. The 68% F1 below is therefore somewhat inflated against what a strict incident-level split would produce. I state it because it changes how the number should be read, and I treat it as an honest baseline rather than a ceiling: the correction for the next iteration is to split at incident level — group every frame belonging to one physical incident, then assign whole incidents to train or test — which will lower the headline figure and make it worth more.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Explainability",
        body: "I applied Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to generate thermal heatmaps over the input, visualising where the network detected structural damage. The point is confirming that the prediction is driven by physical crash indicators rather than background artifacts — a model that has quietly learned a background cue instead of the damage itself still scores well and still fails in service. On a life-critical decision that bridge between the network output and human oversight is the difference between a prediction that can be reviewed and one that can only be trusted.",

        heading: "Results",
        body: "The fine-tuned MobileNetV2 achieved a 68% F1-score on an entirely unseen hold-out test set, read with the frame-level split above attached to it: the figure is somewhat inflated against a strict incident-level split, and an incident-level rerun is the first correction I would make. F1 rather than accuracy is the honest metric here: real-world traffic data is heavily imbalanced, so a high global accuracy could flatter a model that defaults to predicting \"no crash\". F1 evaluates the thing that actually matters, which is whether the model catches the crash events that require an ambulance.",

Once the visual damage assessment is done, the dashboard simulates the dispatch protocol that assessment would trigger — the alert to the Ministry of Interior (122) and Ambulance services (123).",

It was too complex to land in one go, so I cut the same problem down to the one question I could answer end to end — is this scene a crash or not — on a balanced 3,000-scene dataset with a held-out test set to check the answer against. That narrower scope is what made this version shippable and measurable: a single classification target, one metric that means something, and a deployment someone else could open and try. I submitted it as university coursework and it was marked highly. What came out of training and evaluating it fed back into Inqaz, which I am still developing. The two projects address the same problem at different scopes — Inqaz's own detection stack is the dual ResNet-34 system, InqazSceneNet and InqazPoseNet, described on its own page.",
